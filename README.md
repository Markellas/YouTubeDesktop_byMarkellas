# YouTube Desktop by Markella's
This open source app made by me in Electron is YouTube client for Windows. I'm also working on such client for Linux/macOS.

P.S.: Don't worry, you can login in this app with your Google account, because it's based on original YouTube website. I can't see your passwords and even emails)))
